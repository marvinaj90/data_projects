## Citi Bike Analysis

The purpose of this project is to extract, load, and analyze the Citi Bike ridership data. Light cleaing was required on the data set, mostly formatting the column labels and removing NA's as well as outliers. 

The data was then uploaded into a Postgres database using psycopg2. The data was then analyzed for trends in rider count and tripduration broken down over time and gender.
